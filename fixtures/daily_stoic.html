The philosophy asserts that virtue (meaning, chiefly, the four cardinal virtues of self- control, courage, justice, and wisdom) is happiness, and it is our perceptions of things— rather than the things themselves— that cause most of our trouble.

For everything happens according to the nature of all things, and in a short time you’ll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors Hadrian and Augustus are now. The next thing to do— consider carefully the task at hand for what it is, while remembering that your purpose is to be a good human being. Get straight to doing what nature requires of you, and speak as you see most just and fitting— with kindness, modesty, and sincerity.”

Stoics do not seek to have the answer for every question or a plan for every contingency. Yet they’re also not worried. Why? Because they have confidence that they’ll be able to adapt and change with the circumstances. Instead of looking for instruction, they cultivate skills like creativity, independence, self- confidence, ingenuity, and the ability to problem solve. In this way, they are resilient instead of rigid. We can practice the same.
